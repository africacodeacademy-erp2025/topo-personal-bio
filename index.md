# Background

- **Name:** Topo Anthony Morolong
- **Location:** Gaborone, Botswana
- **Education:** About to start my final year in Computer Systems Engineering BAC

Good day to you! I am a resident  developer in the Africa Code Academy Engineering Residency Program 2025.

    i like to break things “Decode. Build. Secure. Repeat.”

## Journey

### Early Life

For me it started with playing my very first game on a desktop computer at home it was running windows xp (I think), I couldn't help but wonder how?. As the years went I took classes on introduction to computing, very boring things 'how to use microsoft word and excel spreedsheet' it wasn't eye openning. In senior school I then did computer studies though still within the microsoft office365 suit I got to write my first pseudocode, met my first database (microsoft access) and my very first computer based project (a gym management system). Finanly I got to hear about programming languages this was at the peek of the covid 19 pandemic and I got to see software making things possible.  

### Goals

- To become a compitent developer.
- To use the program as an anchor into the world of Secure DevOps.
- To be part of a community striving for a better tomorrow

## Projects

### Appointment Booking system

**Tech stack:** _Jakarta EE servlet, Mysql, Html and css_
The goal of this project was to creat part of a hospital management system which was appointment booking. The problem observed was long queuing which consumed valuable work hours for people in need of medical attention and availability of doctors, a very scarce human resource. Simply put a doctor would availe a schedule and those in need of medical attention would pick a date and time from that schedule.
