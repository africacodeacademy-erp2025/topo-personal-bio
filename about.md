I'm an upcoming full stack developer who doesn't build for the hype, I build for clarity, security, and control. Besides being developing I aslo double as a cybersecurity researcher who approaches software like a system to be understood, tested, and hardened. If I'm not breaking and building on a computer, I'm at the basketball court breaking ankle and getting buckets.

**IT officer**
For a period of six months I worked within the ICT Department at Boitekanelo College, where I provided support to both staff and students. My responsibilities included setting up laptops, resetting passwords, configuring printers, and troubleshooting network issues. I gained hands-on experience with enterprise tools such as Active Directory, Microsoft 365, PaperCut, and the Academia student management system.

I was involved in network infrastructure tasks like switch configuration, access point setup, and speed testing. I also participated in departmental meetings and contributed to the development of a network extension proposal.

This placement enhanced my technical skills, improved my communication and teamwork abilities, and gave me a realistic understanding of professional ICT operations in an academic environment.
